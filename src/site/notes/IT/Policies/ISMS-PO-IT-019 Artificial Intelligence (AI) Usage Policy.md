## **1. PURPOSE**  
To establish guidelines for the secure, ethical, and compliant use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems, including generative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot, Bard), machine learning models, and automated decision systems within the organization.
## **2. SCOPE**
This policy applies to:
- All employees, contractors, and third parties using or integrating AI into business processes
- Any data processed by AI systems, whether in development, testing, or production
- Commercial AI tools, APIs, cloud services, and open-source AI libraries
## **3. POLICY STATEMENTS** 
#### 3.1 Acceptable Use
- AI tools may only be used for **authorized business purposes**
- Prohibited uses:
    - Generating or spreading misinformation 
    - Making unverified autonomous decisions in regulated domains (e.g., legal, HR, finance)
    - Processing personal or sensitive data without proper safeguards
#### 3.2 Data Input and Confidentiality
- Do **not** input confidential, proprietary, or personal data into public AI tools
- Only use anonymized or non-sensitive datasets for training or prompting unless on approved platforms
- Use **internal AI sandboxes** or vetted private AI environments for business-sensitive use
#### 3.3 Model Evaluation & Validation
- All internally developed or deployed AI models must undergo:
    - **Bias testing**
    - **Security review**
    - **Explainability assessment** (for critical decisions)
    - Documentation of training data sources
#### 3.4 Security Requirements
- AI systems must comply with secure coding, data protection, and vulnerability management practices
- API access must be authenticated and monitored
- Prompt injection and adversarial attack vectors must be tested in deployment
#### 3.5 Governance & Compliance
- Usage must align with:
    - Data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA)
    - Industry-specific rules (e.g., financial services, healthcare)
- A **use case registry** must be maintained to track AI deployments and risk classification
