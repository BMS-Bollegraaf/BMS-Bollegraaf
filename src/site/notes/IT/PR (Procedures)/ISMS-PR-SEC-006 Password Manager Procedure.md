## **1. PURPOSE**

## **4. PASSWORD VAULT SETUP**

|Step|Action|
|---|---|

## **5. PASSWORD CREATION STANDARDS**
- Passwords must be **auto-generated** by the password manager
- Minimum: 16+ characters, mix of upper/lowercase, numbers, symbols
- **Never reuse passwords** across systems
- Use of **passphrases** (e.g., correct-horse-battery-staple) for master passwords is encouraged
## **6. SECURE SHARING**  
- Credentials must **never be shared via email, chat, or documents**
- Use the password managerâ€™s **secure sharing features**
- Shared credentials must be stored in **team vaults** with access logging
- When a team member leaves or changes role:
    - Access must be **revoked immediately**
    - Passwords must be **rotated if shared**
## **7. MONITORING & COMPLIANCE**
