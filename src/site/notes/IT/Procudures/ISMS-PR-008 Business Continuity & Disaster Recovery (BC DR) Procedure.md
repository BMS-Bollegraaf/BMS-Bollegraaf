## **1. PURPOSE**  
To ensure that the organization can maintain or rapidly resume critical operations in the event of a disaster, cyberattack, system failure, or other business disruption.
## **2. SCOPE**
Applies to:
- All critical business functions, locations, systems, and third-party services
- Events including IT outages, facility damage, cyber incidents, and natural disasters
## **3. BC/DR FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW**
#### 3.1 Business Continuity (BC)
Focuses on maintaining essential services with minimal disruption.
#### 3.2 Disaster Recovery (DR)
Focuses on restoring IT systems, applications, and data following a major disruption.
 
## **4. KEY COMPONENTS**
#### 4.1 Business Impact Analysis (BIA)
- Identify critical processes and Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs) / Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs)
- Classify systems and dependencies by priority leve
#### 4.2 Risk Assessment
- Identify threats (cyber, fire, flood, vendor failure)
- Mitigation strategies documented and tested
#### 4.3 DR Plan
- Recovery procedures for systems, infrastructure, and applications
- Includes contact lists, escalation paths, and backup/recovery locations
#### 4.4 BC Plan
- Manual workarounds or alternate sites
- Communication plans for staff, customers, and authorities

## **5. ACTIVATION CRITERIA**  
DR/BC plans are activated when:
- Critical systems are unavailable beyond RTO
- Data integrity is compromised
- Physical premises are inaccessible
## **6. TESTING & REVIEW**  
- BC/DR plans must be tested **at least annually**:
    - Tabletop exercises
    - Partial failover tests
    - Full recovery simulations (if feasible)
- Lessons learned are documented and used to improve plans
## **7. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITY**
