## **1. WHY IT MATTERS**  
Printed documents can contain **confidential, personal, or sensitive information**. If left unattended, they can be accessed, copied, or discarded improperly — leading to **data breaches** or **compliance violations**.
## **2. SECURE PRINTING: WHAT YOU MUST DO**
1. **Use Secure Print Release**
    - Always send your print jobs to **secure queues** (e.g., "NLBRSIN")
    - Retrieve them by swiping your badge or entering a PIN at the printer
    - Don’t use unsecured “print-to-device” options for sensitive content
        
2. **Collect Immediately**
    - Go directly to the printer after submitting your job
    - Never leave printed documents sitting in trays
    - If a print fails, **cancel it from the queue** immediately
3. **Handle with Care**
    - Print only what you need
    - Store sensitive documents in **locked drawers or folders**
    - Shred drafts and unneeded copies using approved bins
        
4. **Be Mindful of What You Print**
    - Don’t print:
        - Passwords
        - Personal employee or customer data
        - Financials or contracts unless necessary
    - Use digital versions when possible (e.g., PDFs with access control)
        
5. **Print Classification**
    - Match your document’s classification to how you handle it:
        - **Internal** → Retrieve promptly
        - **Confidential** → Secure print + locked storage
        - **Restricted** → Only if absolutely necessary + shredded after use
 
## **3. IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG**

- **Paper jam or uncollected document?** → Notify [[Functions/IT Support\|IT Support]] and shred leftover output
- **Found unattended prints?** → Place in the "Unclaimed Prints" tray or report to IT
- **Unauthorized use?** → Report immediately to [[Functions/IT Support\|IT Support]] or your manager
## **4. WHAT NOT TO DO**
- ❌ Don’t print and walk away
- ❌ Don’t let others collect your printouts
- ❌ Don’t discard sensitive material in regular bins
- ❌ Don’t print confidential info from personal devices or public Wi-Fi
