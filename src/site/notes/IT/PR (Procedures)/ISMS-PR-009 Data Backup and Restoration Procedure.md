## **1. PURPOSE**  
To define a structured approach to backing up and restoring data, systems, and configurations to ensure **data availability**, **business continuity**, and **protection from loss or corruption**.
## **2. SCOPE**
This procedure applies to:
- All production servers, databases, file shares, cloud services, and critical applications
- Backup media (cloud, on-prem, removable storage)
- Staff involved in configuring, managing, or validating backups
## **3. BACKUP TYPES AND FREQUENCIES**

| Type                              | Frequency                 | Retention   |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------- |
| Full Back-up                      | Weekly                    | 4 weeks     |
| Incremental Backup                | Daily                     | 7 days      |
| Snapshot / VM Image               | Hourly (critical systems) | 24â€“48 hours |
| Offsite Replication               | Daily                     | 30+ days    |
| Cloud-to-Cloud Backup (e.g. M365) | Daily                     | 90 days     |
 ## **4. BACKUP PROCEDURE**
#### 4.1 Setup
- Identify critical systems and classify data
- Configure backup policies in central platform (e.g., Veeam, Acronis, Azure)
- Encrypt backups in transit and at rest
- Store backups in **2 different physical or cloud locations**
#### 4.2 Monitoring
- Enable daily backup job notifications
- [[IT/IT\|IT]] to review **backup status reports** every morning
- Log all failures and retry within SLA
#### 4.3 Validation
- Perform **restore tests monthly** for critical systems
- Document test outcomes in the **Restore Test Log**
- Retain logs for at least 12 month.
## **5. RESTORATION PROCEDURE**  
#### When restoration is needed:
1. Submit a **Restore Request Ticket** to IT
2. Identify affected system/data and required recovery point
3. Confirm business justification and impact
4. IT retrieves data and restores to:
    - Same location (overwrite), or
    - Alternate recovery environment (sandbox/testing)
#### After restoration:
- Validate data integrity with requester
- Document restoration outcome
- Update backup register with event.
## **6. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITY**

| Role              | Responsibilty                                                  |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[IT/IT\|IT]]            | Configure and manage backups, test restorations                |
| [[Functions/System Owners\|System Owners]] | Identify recovery priorities, assist validation                |
| [[Functions/ISMS Manager\|ISMS Manager]]  | Audit backup logs, ensure retention policies align             |
| End Users         | Request restores via proper channels, verify data upon restore |
## **7. SECURITY & COMPLIANCE**  
- All backups must be **encrypted using AES-256**
- Access to backup platforms restricted to authorized personnel
- Cloud backup providers must be ISO 27001/SOC 2 certified
- Follow **GDPR/NIS2** for data retention and destruction

## **8. REVIEW & MAINTENANCE**
Procedure must be reviewed **annually**, or after:
- Significant infrastructure change
- Disaster recovery exercise
- Backup failure or audit finding
